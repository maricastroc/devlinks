# Link Management System

This is a link management system that allows users to create, store, share and manage links with detailed information. The application uses PostgreSQL for database management and provides user-friendly interfaces to handle link details efficiently.

## 📋 Features

- Create, read, update, delete links and see previews in the mobile mockup
- Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
- Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
- Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
- Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Laravel (PHP): Backend to manage the system, user authentication, and business logic.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing link and user data.
- React.js: Frontend for user interaction.
- Tailwind CSS: CSS framework for styling.
- Inertia.js: Framework for integration between Laravel backend and React frontend.
